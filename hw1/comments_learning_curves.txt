How curves was constructed: The train set was randomly split into a fraction of its original size, then used to build the decision trees
First dataset (train.dat) learning curve: 100 datapoints corresponding to accuracy of decision tree made using 1%-100% of the original training set
- This curve looks like a typical learning curve, which more datapoints do dimishing return impact on the acccuracy of the model.
Second dataset (train2.dat) learning curve: 50 datapoints corresponding to accuracy of decision tree made using 2%-100% of the original training set
- This curve on average take a similar shape to first curve, but is unstable. Perhaps random selection of data is a bad idea on this dataset
Third dataset (train3.dat) learning curve: 50 datapoints corresponding to accuracy of decision tree made using 2%-100% of the original training set
- This curve on average looks like a straight line! This is an indication that the dataset might not be big enough to be representative of the population
Fourth dataset (train4.dat) learning curve: 100 datapoints corresponding to accuracy of decision tree made using 1%-100% of the original training set
- This curve on average looks like a straight line! This is an indication that the dataset might not be big enough to be representative of the population
